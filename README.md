## Project Description
Hangman is a classic word guessing game. This project is a Python implementation of the game. The aim of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way to play Hangman in the console. The game starts with a default number of lives and a random word from a provided list. The user guesses one letter at a time, with the goal of guessing the entire word. This project helped me learn about handling user input, working with strings and lists, and structuring a program using classes and methods.
